  <h2>Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px; max-width: 600px; text-align: justify;">
  Mahatma Gandhi, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar, Gujarat, was a visionary leader and the driving force behind India's struggle for independence from British rule. Known for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance or <em>Satyagraha</em>, Gandhi led transformative movements like the Salt March and Quit India Movement. He championed civil rights, religious harmony, and upliftment of the poor. Revered as the "Father of the Nation," Gandhi's legacy of peace and justice continues to inspire global movements. He was tragically assassinated on 30 January 1948 in New Delhi.
