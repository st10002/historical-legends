            Bhagat Singh, born on 28 September 1907 in Banga, Punjab (now in Pakistan), was a fearless revolutionary who became a national hero in India’s struggle for independence. Deeply moved by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, he joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association and carried out bold acts against British rule, including the assassination of British officer John Saunders and the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1929. Known for his intellect and writings, including “Why I Am an Atheist,” he inspired generations with his ideals of justice and equality. He was executed at the age of 23 on 23 March 1931, and is remembered as Shaheed-e-Azam (Great Martyr) for his ultimate sacrifice.
