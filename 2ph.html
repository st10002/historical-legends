<p style="font-size: 16px; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">
Lal Bahadur Shastri, born on 2 October 1904 in Uttar Pradesh, was India’s second Prime Minister and a symbol of humility and integrity. Deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, he participated in the freedom struggle and served in key ministerial roles before leading the nation from 1964 to 1966. He guided India through the 1965 war with Pakistan and coined the patriotic slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan,” emphasizing the strength of both soldiers and farmers. His leadership promoted agricultural and dairy reforms, and he remains a beloved figure in Indian history. He passed away in Tashkent in 1966 after signing a peace agreement.</p>
